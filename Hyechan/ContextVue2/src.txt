Synopsis: Mae C. Jemison was born on October 17, 1956, in Decatur, Alabama. She went to Stanford at age 16 and earned a degree in chemical engineering. She graduated from medical school at Cornell in 1981 and practiced medicine for several years. On June 4, 1987, Dr. Jemison became the first African-American woman to be admitted into the astronaut training program. On September 12, 1992, Jemison finally flew into space with six other astronauts aboard the Endeavour on mission STS-47, becoming the first African-American woman in space. In recognition of her accomplishments, Jemison has received several awards and honorary doctorates.

Early Life
Astronaut and physician Mae C. Jemison was born on October 17, 1956, in Decatur, Alabama, the youngest child of Charlie Jemison, a roofer and a carpenter, and Dorothy (Green) Jemison, an elementary school teacher. Her sister, Ada Jemison Bullock, became a child psychiatrist, and her brother, Charles Jemison, is a real estate broker. The family moved to Chicago, Illinois, when Jemison was 3 years old to take advantage of better educational opportunities there, and it is that city that she calls her hometown.

Throughout her early school years, Jemison's parents were supportive and encouraging of her talents and abilities. She spent a considerable amount of time in her school library reading about all aspects of science, especially astronomy. During her time at Morgan Park High School, she became convinced that she wanted to pursue a career in biomedical engineering. When she graduated in 1973 as a consistent honor student, she entered Stanford University at age 16 on a National Achievement Scholarship.

Initial Career Choice
As she had been in high school, Jemison was very involved in extracurricular activities at Stanford, including dance and theater productions. She served as head of the Black Student Union. She received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from Stanford in 1977. Upon graduation, she entered Cornell University Medical College and, during her years there, found time to expand her horizons by studying in Cuba and Kenya and working at a Cambodian refugee camp in Thailand.  

After she earned her M.D. in 1981, Jemison interned at Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Center and later worked as a general practitioner. For the next two-and-a-half years, she was the Area Peace Corps Medical Officer for Sierra Leone and Liberia, where she also taught and did medical research. Following her return to the United States in 1985, Jemison made a career change. She decided to follow a dream she had nurtured for a long time. In October of that year, she applied for admission to NASA's astronaut training program. The Challenger disaster of January 1986 delayed the selection process, but when she reapplied a year later, Jemison was one of the 15 candidates chosen from a field of about 2,000.

First African-American Female Astronaut
When Jemison was chosen on June 4, 1987, she became the first African-American woman to be admitted into the astronaut training program. After more than a year of training, she became the first African-American female astronaut, earning the title of science mission specialist  a job that would make her responsible for conducting crew-related scientific experiments on the space shuttle.

When Jemison finally flew into space on September 12, 1992, with six other astronauts aboard the Endeavour on mission STS-47, she became the first African-American woman in space. The first thing she saw from space was her hometown of Chicago. During her eight days in space, she conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on the crew and herself. In all, she spent more than 190 hours in space before returning to Earth on September 20, 1992. Following her historic flight, Jemison noted that society should recognize how much both women and members of other minority groups can contribute if given the opportunity.

Honors And Recognition
In recognition of her accomplishments, Jemison has received a number of accolades, including several honorary doctorates, the 1988 Essence Science and Technology Award, the Ebony Black Achievement Award in 1992, a Montgomery Fellowship from Dartmouth College in 1993 and induction into the National Women's Hall of Fame in 1993. She was also named Gamma Sigma Gamma Woman of the Year in 1990. An alternative public school in Detroit, Michigan, the Mae C. Jemison Academy, was named after her in 1992.

Jemison has been a member of several professional organizations, including the American Medical Association, the American Chemical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. She served on the board of directors of the World Sickle Cell Foundation from 1990 to 1992. She has also served as an advisory committee member of the American Express Geography Competition and an honorary board member of the Center for the Prevention of Childhood Malnutrition.

After leaving the astronaut corps in March 1993, Jemison accepted a teaching fellowship at Dartmouth. She established her own company, the Jemison Group, which researches, develops and markets advanced technologies.

In every town there's an old abandoned house or two, a forlorn-looking former residence with broken windows, an old linen curtain blowing in the wind, a roof in need of patching. Have you walked or driven past a rundown, empty house and wondered about the lives once lived inside it? The generations of children who took their first steps on its wooden floors and screamed with glee on the old tire swing still hanging from a tree in the backyard? An abandoned house says, "Move along. There is no life here. No one wants this place." But still, we stop and stare. Who lived here? Who planted those roses? Where are they now? What happened to them?

Every town has a few houses like this, but the city of Detroit, Michigan, has far more than its share. Detroit's 138.8 square miles include thousands of abandoned homes (some estimate as many as 12,000 at any given time  enough for a small city of people to live in). It has thousands more empty lots where homes once stood, where they were burned and then bulldozed into their own basements. Detroit was once home to more than 2 million people, but now it has a population of less than half that. It is a city missing a million souls. Like each old, abandoned house, Detroit seems to say, "Move along. There's nothing here." But still you stop and stare. Who lived here? Where are they now? What happened to this place?

Imagine growing up in a nice, safe neighborhood with well-tended houses and neighbors who look out for one another. After high school, you leave your neighborhood for years to travel around the world. When you return, you find that many of your neighbors have moved away. Some of their homes sit empty, while others are occupied by criminals or drug dealers. It's no longer safe for kids to play on the playgrounds. Packs of wild dogs roam freely. People come from other neighborhoods and even other cities to dump truckloads of garbage into abandoned buildings or right in the middle of the street. The neighborhood factories, warehouses and businesses are mostly closed and covered in graffiti.

That's pretty much what happened to Tyree Guyton, who grew up on Heidelberg Street on Detroit's east side. When he returned home after a stint with the Army, Tyree said it looked like a bomb had gone off in his neighborhood. From the front porch of his grandfather's house in 1986, Tyree said he heard the "soft crying of a wounded city." Many people had moved elsewhere. Violence, crime and racial tensions had driven them to suburbs where they no longer had to live in large, multifamily homes  each family could have its own small home on its own lot. Many of the jobs in the auto factories that had provided Detroiters with steady, high-paying work were now done by machines. Factories, like people, had moved out to distant suburbs where land was cheap. The government tore down neighborhoods to build highways that sped people, and jobs, out of the city. In many neighborhoods, the only people left were those too stubborn or too poor to leave.

Rather than move himself, or despair, Tyree Guyton vowed to do something about the problems that faced his neighborhood and his city. Tyree thought of his grandfather, a painter of houses and buildings who'd lived on Heidelberg Street since 1947. When Tyree was 9 years old, his grandfather put a paintbrush in his hand and taught him to bring what was cold and drab to life with vibrant color. And so Tyree, now 62, set out with a paintbrush to turn what many called "blight" into something else entirely.

Tyree's grandfather loved jellybeans, and jellybeans had always reminded Tyree of people: different colors on the outside, but essentially the same within. Tyree considered the jellybean a symbol, and when rendered with Tyree's paintbrush it became a colorful polka dot. Tyree painted thousands of polka dots on his grandfather's house. Different-colored dots began appearing on vacant houses, sidewalks, and streets. Slowly, the color spread into other neighborhoods. Every abandoned house or building received a human-sized dot. Nearly a quarter-century later, many of the thousands of abandoned homes in Detroit still bloom with the colorful dots painted by Tyree Guyton.

But he did not stop with dots. Enlisting the help of his beloved grandfather, his wife, and neighborhood children, Tyree walked up and down the streets and alleys of his neighborhood, dragging discarded objects back to Heidelberg Street. In his beat-up old pickup, they scoured other neighborhoods for junk left in vacant houses and lots. Patterns began to emerge: things that were left behind on one block were often the same on the next. Tyree amassed vast collections of old-fashioned vacuum cleaners, television sets, telephones, women's shoes, suitcases, baby dolls, and stuffed animals. Tyree piled and arranged them in vacant lots, nailed them to vacant houses and dead trees. These household items were rescued from empty homes and the stories of the owners who'd abandoned them to become part of a bigger story told by Tyree's art. It was the story of Detroit, a city left behind, and Tyree Guyton had brought that story out into the streets.

Not everyone liked what Tyree was doing. Some didn't like his paintings. Others didn't like the cars and even tour buses full of rubberneckers that had started to creep along Heidelberg Street. Stuffed animals nailed to trees started to smell; once they'd resembled beloved cartoon characters, but rain and harsh winters melted them into a sludgy anonymity. Several residents of the neighborhood viewed the piles of objects not as art but trash. They called it dangerous. They said Tyree was a vandal, not an artist, arguing that Heidelberg Street was now nothing more than extraordinary blight. In 1991 (and again in 1999) the city government sent in bulldozers to destroy some of Tyree's larger piled objects and several abandoned houses that had become part of the project. By 1999, Tyree was a world-renowned artist and his lawyers argued in a court case that Tyree's work was art, protected under the U.S. Constitution. The city argued that the piles of shoes and purses hanging from trees were safety hazards and certainly not art. But the court agreed with Tyree. According to the law, at least, this was art.

Since the bulldozers last rolled through, the Heidelberg Project has flourished. Now, 275,000 people visit the project every year; it has become one of Detroit's top tourist attractions. The street and its homes are an ever-changing canvas. Imagine you are visiting Detroit today: You walk through a neighborhood where only a few houses remain. Some are occupied; others sit with their doors wide open, the scars of recent fires on their walls and roofs, years of neglect leaving them gloomy and gray. Soon every abandoned building you see is decorated by a brightly painted dot. You are getting close. A male pheasant with his colorful plumage darts across your path and flies low into a prairie where a whole block of houses once stood. In the distance you see another flash of color: doors painted blue and red and orange are piled precariously on top of each other. A hundred colorful faces painted on old car hoods watch you arrive. A sign welcomes you to the Heidelberg Project, but your eyes are too busy to read it. Everywhere there is color, everywhere there is something new and unexpected to see: a house painted with a hundred clocks, another guarded by five metal robots, a dead tree with half a dozen shopping carts dangling from its limbs 50 feet in the air. And there, in the middle of it all, is a man climbing out of a pickup truck. The truck has a bumper sticker with a single blue circle against a background of white. This is Tyree Guyton. He might have been in Paris or Berlin last week, sharing his story with the world, but today he is right here, still pulling objects he's found on the street from the back of his truck, still painting circles on houses where people no longer live. You can walk right up and ask him, "Is this just junk, or is it art?" and he'll probably just smile and suggest you walk around the project and decide for yourself.

You might not be used to thinking of a pile of shoes or an old boat filled with stuffed animals as art, but there is something about this place. The colors are dizzying. Purses dangle from trees like strange vines. There are children playing here. The drug dealers moved out a long time ago. Suburban people walk around a neighborhood they might have been afraid to drive through years ago. There are tourists with cameras from all across the world. This is not a dead place. This place is very much alive  and it's still evolving. In August 2016, Guyton announced that he'll be dismantling some of the smaller, less prominent installations on Heidelberg Street. They'll be removed to make room for Heidelberg 3.0, a new vision to transform the project into a community center and a self-sustaining arts and culture village featuring an artist in residence program, a new studio and gallery for emerging artists, and an education and event space for neighborhood events and youth programming.
